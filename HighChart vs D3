HighCharts is amazing. Though the license is not commercially free but it’s worth the penny. I liked it especially because of the following reasons.
Built using SVG which gives us the flexibility of applying CSS styles
Easy to customize with a lot of options
We created a bar-graph with the exact same design as it was provided by the client in the PSD — Worked well
Easy Tooltip integration
Easy to sync between different charts
Highly documented
Supports a wide-range of standard plotting
What we didn’t like
Doesn’t have cross-filter. By cross-filter I mean, few other graphs provided an option which synced the dataset between different graphs on the page

D3:

D3 is the de-facto for JavaScript chartings. It’s amazing and it can be used to visualize a wide range of data-set. Good things include
Built using SVG for easier customization
Easy to plot non-standard visualization: It is not specific to Graphs or Charting and can be used for any type of visualization. As the name itself suggests, it is more of “data driven documents”
Highly customizable because of it’s low-level API
Liked dc.js (http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) — Built on top of D3, something like HighCharts but less documented. Has cross-filter between the graphs
What I didn’t like (especially for my use-case)
Too low level
It’s like re-inventing the wheel
Conclusion
If you’re looking for a non-standard visualization or a true Open source solution, you should use D3. For something commercial with a known standard type of plotting, you should use HighCharts.
